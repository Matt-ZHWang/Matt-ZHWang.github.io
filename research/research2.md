Another approach to understanding the universe is **Bayesian in spirit**—starting from fundamental theories to **reproduce, interpret, and predict** observations. Thus, **numerical simulations** and **semi-analytic models** also serve as powerful tools in this endeavor.


### 「1」Multi-scale investigation of SFE at high-redshift galaxies: universal star formation revealed in thesan-zoom

Link (Coming soon!)

Ever since JWST revealed an excess of massive galaxies at high redshift, both theoretical and observational studies have increasingly argued for an elevated baryon conversion efficiency in the early universe. However, understanding star formation in galaxies is inherently complex, as it emerges from the interplay of multiple physical scales and processes. Therefore, it is essential to examine which scales and mechanisms are responsible for the apparent increase in global star formation efficiency (SFE).

In this work, we extend the analysis of [Shen2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01949) to investigate the connection between **global (galaxy-scale)** and **local (cloud-scale)** SFE at high redshift, using the state-of-the-art cosmological zoom-in simulation suite, thesan-zoom.

We find that **star formation in these systems is predominantly hosted by filamentary giant molecular clouds (GMCs)** embedded in dense interstellar media (ISM) and subjected to strong external pressure. At the GMC scale, **star formation appears universal across redshifts and halo masses**. GMCs maintain a nearly constant **gas surface density**, while their **dark matter surface density increases with redshift**, leading to the emergence of **DM-dominated GMCs at $z > 10$**, which could exhibit elevated SFEs. Moreover, we find that the **GMC mass fraction** is the dominant factor shaping the global SFR–surface density relation.
