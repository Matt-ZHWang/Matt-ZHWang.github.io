My name is Zihao(Matthew) Wang, currently a fourth-year undergraduate student in [School of Astronomy & Space Science, Nanjing University](https://astronomy.nju.edu.cn/EN/index.html). I have been admitted to the Ph.D. program at the [Department of Astronomy, School of Physics, Peking University](https://astro.pku.edu.cn/). Previously, I was a visiting student at MIT. I study galaxy formation and evolution as well as star formation, combining approaches such as machine learning and numerical simulations, with a primary focus on high-redshift galaxies. To achieve a more comprehensive understanding of the universe, I aim to reconstruct the cosmos using large-sample data from cutting-edge observational facilities, and to reproduce, interpret, and predict the observed universe through state-of-the-art numerical simulations.
