My name is Zihao (Matthew) Wang, currently a fourth-year undergraduate student in [School of Astronomy & Space Science, Nanjing University](https://astronomy.nju.edu.cn/EN/index.html). I have been admitted to the Ph.D. program at the [Department of Astronomy, School of Physics, Peking University](https://astro.pku.edu.cn/). Previously, I was a visiting student at MIT. I study galaxy formation and evolution as well as star formation, combining approaches such as machine learning and numerical simulations, with a primary focus on high-redshift galaxies.

### Research Highlights
- I develop a hyrid method of Machine Learning and template sythesis for efficient galaxy parameter estimation (Wang in prep.).
- I conduct a multi-scale analysis of star formation efficiency across different scales in high-redshift galaxies using thesan-zoom (Wang in prep.).
- I conduct long-term monitoring on meteors and sky light at Zuodijiang Observatary, recording 3,000+ sporadic meteors.
